Aerobic Exercise and Resistance Training for Diabetes (STUDY) From shape-able.com
In studies where aerobic training and resistance training were directly compared, no statistically significant differences were observed. This investigation compared the combined effect of resistance and aerobic exercise as well as the different sequences of these two modalities on epoc. Combined exercise training was performed on a motor treadmill (aerobic training) and on a ladder adapted for rats (resistance training), on alternate days, 5 days/week, for 8 weeks.

<p>There is a dearth of data investigating the effects of resistance or combined resistance and aerobic exercise training interventions on cognitive function in patients with copd. Strength training included core exercises (back extension and abdominal crunches) and 10 resistance exercises on stackedâweight machines (leg press, leg extension, leg curl, chest press, lat pull, shoulder. For example, it would be interesting to explore this hypothesis in patients with cerebrovascular pathologies. Less is known about interval training in this population.
