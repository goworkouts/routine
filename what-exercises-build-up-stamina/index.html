How to Improve Stamina Exercises and Tips eMediHealth From emedihealth.com
You must have probably noticed that it is much easier for you to lose your breath whenever you walk up a hill or raised sidewalk, as compared to walking on a flat surface. While we all may fall in love with a specific exercise, it is important to spruce things up. In fact, people who are 50 or more pounds overweight may find cycling on a stationary bike the ideal first exercise option because it can improve cardiovascular health sans the mechanical stress on the back, hips, knees, and ankles secondary to walking. You have to be consistent with your training to increase running stamina.
