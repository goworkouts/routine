<p>Cardiac troponin levels are normally so low that they cannot be detected with most blood tests. When you go to the emergency ward at the hospital with chest pain, blood samples will be drawn and the levels of cardiac enzymes checked two or three times over a period of several hours to ascertain if you are suffering from heart. Below 100 mg/dl (below 70 mg/dl if you’re diabetic or have a high risk of heart disease). Elevations of cardiac enzyme levels should be interpreted in the context of clinical and ecg findings [ 1].
