Your normal heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times the heart beats per minute at rest. This will lower blood pressure. In a normal person, the heart rate and blood pressure progressively increase with progressive exercise. In some cases, heart rate has a direct effect on blood pressure.

<p>The rise in blood pressure is mostly in the systolic pressure. The pulse can be felt at various points on the body where the arteries are just under the skin, such as the temples, neck, crook of the. Because of these changes, it took some time for everything to turn back to normal after. Along with an increase in heart rate, the force of your heart's contractions also increases while exercising, so more blood is pumped with each beat.</p>

<p>Your normal heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times the heart beats per minute at rest. Let us now understand in details how exercise affects blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart contracts. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete. Figure 3.
