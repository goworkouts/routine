Aerobic Capacity lesson 1 From slideshare.net
Among these are exercises that can be classified into movements that will require either aerobic or anaerobic capacity. Aerobic capacity, also called maximal oxygen uptake, is characterized by the amount of oxygen the body produces and circulates to all major organs to regulate systemic homeostasis. These include activities like brisk walking, cycling, climbing, and running. 🐢 there’s a time and place for high intensity.
