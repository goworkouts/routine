What&#39;s the Difference Between Aerobic and Anaerobic Exercise? Aaptiv From aaptiv.com
There are quite a few differences between yoga and aerobic exercises. On the contrary, aerobic exercises are used mainly when your body uses oxygen to fuel your energy extraction process. Aerobic and anaerobic exercises are two very diverse ways in which the body acquires the energy it needs to function (although they sound similar, we know). Muscles then use this oxygen for the transformation of food into energy.
