Now an artificial heart patch can repair damage caused after a heart From hindustantimes.com
Cardiac troponin t levels remain elevated for at least seven days after a heart attack, which is much longer than after prolonged exercise. “high levels of exercise over time may cause stress on the arteries leading to higher cac,” dr. This causes the overall function of the heart to lessen. But the heart does have some ability to make new muscle and possibly repair itself.
