<p>As physical exercise increases, sympathetic nerves stimulate the heart to beat with more force and faster to pump extra oxygen to the cells thus increasing the heart rate. In this science activity, youâll measure your heart rate during different types of physical activities to find out which gives your heart the best workout to help keep it fit. The aim of the systematic review was to assess whether regular exercise or sports have an impact on the rhr in healthy subjects by taking different types of sports into account.
