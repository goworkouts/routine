Muscular strength, on the other hand, refers to your muscles’ ability to work against resisting forces (like barbells). Instead, structural proteins are added to muscle fibers in a process. Muscular strength is defined as the ability of your nervous and muscular systems to produce enough force in your connective tissues and muscles to move an external force, such as weight or your body against gravity.

<p>Muscular endurance is a muscle's, or group of muscles', ability to repeat a specific movement over and over again. An endurance sport is any sport where there is a requirement to sustain an activity level whilst enduring a level of physical stress. Fatigue is the inability to persist in activity or the gradual reduction in activity and so is the opposite of endurance. Conversely, a lack of use can result in decreased performance and muscle appearance. NEGATIVE Study Isometric contraction, Hand therapy, Muscle.</p>

<p>Fatigue is the inability to persist in activity or the gradual reduction in activity and so is the opposite of endurance. Local muscle endurance is best described as the ability to resist muscular fatigue and describes how a given type of contraction can be sustained, typically measured in terms of the number of repetitions.

<p>Physical training alters the appearance of skeletal muscles and can produce changes in muscle performance. Muscular endurance is the ability to exert you for long periods of time and to recover quickly from an activity or trauma. Read on to learn more. Muscular strength, on the other hand, refers to your muscles’ ability to work against resisting forces (like barbells). PPT The Anatomy and Physiology of the Muscular System PowerPoint.</p>
