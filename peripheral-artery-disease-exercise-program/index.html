<p>Peripheral artery disease (pad) is a common circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the limbs. Supervised exercise training for peripheral artery disease (set pad) is a program of supervised exercise rehabilitation, considered a primary treatment for people with peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication, the aching pain felt in the legs during walking or exercising. Studies have shown that supervised exercise has better. Treadmill walking is the featured workout in supervised pad programs.</p>
