The cubic relationship between exercise heart rate and preference for From researchgate.net
If you test people who do high intensity cardiovascular exercise and those who do not exercise,than the people who do high intensity exercise will have a lower heart rate because their heart is more effecient. This would be 90 to 126 beats per minute for someone age 40. The more oxygen consumed during a vo2 maximal test, the more carbon dioxide is being produced. If you&#39;re working on your cardio fitness, heart rate tracking is an effective way of gauging both your workout intensity and how your fitness improves.

<p>In general, a lower resting heart rate and quicker recovery in your heart rate after exercise signal better fitness. So, if your maximal heart rate is 180 bpm, the low end of the range (50 percent) would be 90 bpm, and the high end of the range (80 percent) would be.

<p>During vigorous exercise, the target heart rate is 70. Your breathing rate is measured in a similar manner, with an average resting rate of 12 to 20 breaths per minute. The direct relationship between exercise and respiratory rate is that you will begin to take in more oxygen — about three to four times as much, to be exact. Just as exercise raises your heart rate, it also raises your breathing rate. Figure 3 from Relationship Between Heart Rate Reserve And VO2 Reserve.</p>

<p>This is the number of beats per minute (bpm) at which your heart should be beating during aerobic exercise. The first dash point for the immediate physiological responses to training is heart rate. A strong positive correlation between increased work rate and a proportional increase in both heart rate and vo2 was found when assessing the results and formulating the graphs.

<p>The more oxygen consumed during a vo2 maximal test, the more carbon dioxide is being produced. When you exercise at the highest possible intensity, your heart will reach maximal heart rate (hrmax), the fastest rate it is capable of beating. The difference in peak heart rate was significantly different between the ages of 40 and 59, with men having higher peak heart rates.

<p>Resting heart rate was significantly higher for women than men, and the heart rate reserve was lower in women than men. The relationship between exercise intensity and heart rate and blood pressure is wellestablished in the context of isometric exercise, which differs from the cardiovascular response to isotonic. That doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll be taking more breaths. Dynamic and static exercise engaging large and small muscle masses were studied in four different experiments.
