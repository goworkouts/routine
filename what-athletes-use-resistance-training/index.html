Five resistance elements that develop athletes the biggest mistake coaches make with resistance training. There is (1) olympic lifting (where athletes lift the weight overhead like you see in the olympics), (2) power lifting (a competition where athletes perform the squat, dead lift, and bench press), and (3) weight lifting (a sport where athletes lift heavy weights—typically fewer than six reps). A weight workout can consist of several kinds of equipment, including free weights (barbells, dumbbells, plates), machines, cables, and even some bodyweight moves. We are starting to move away from this recommendation.
