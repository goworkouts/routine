This paper then dwells on aerobic and anaerobic types of physical exercises, as indispensible indices to human cardiovascular development fitness. On the other hand, the oxygen demand in anaerobic exercise is much higher, resulting in increased production of lactate and shorter.

<p>For anaerobic exercise, the muscles will use stored energy sources to fuel itself rather than oxygen, which includes breaking down glucose. The aerobic activities , therefore, are directly related to respiratory and cardiac system, so that may continue for a longer time interval. Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is neither oxygen nor pyruvate derivatives. Aerobic activity is any type of activity performed for long periods of time at submaximal intensities — meaning, you could perform that activity at that intensity for at least 10 minutes.
