Three of them stand out most. When you start out with running on a treadmill using a treadmill with inaccurate readings can be a real challenge. For example, if the belt length was 3 meters, and it took 20 seconds for it to do 15 revolutions, then the speed is (3 x 15) / 20 = 2.25 meters/second (or 8.1 km/hr or 5 mph). The combination of a moving belt and the lack of air resistance makes a level treadmill run easier, allowing you to run at a faster pace at the same effort level.
