The Effects of Resistance Training vs Endurance Training on Muscle From sbyireview.com
In female athletes, the situation was quite different. Endurance exercise training exerts many positive effects on health, including improved metabol­ ism, reduction of cardiovascular risk, and reduced all­cause and cardiovascular mortality. Endurance training has known effects on the heart and lungs including cardiac hypertrophy, a decreased resting heart rate, increased stroke volume, and increased skeletal capillary density and hypertrophy (3). As its name may suggest, aerobic endurance is built by engaging in cardiovascular, or aerobic, exercise.
