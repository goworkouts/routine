<p>It is the amount of feed which “disappears” from a production site divided by the weight increase produced in the animals to which it is delivered. The net production is 3,400 minus 300 which equals 3,100 pounds. According to several studies, a marketable sized grown catfish converts the feed more efficiently. Efficient conversion of feed to biomass is the quintessential feature of a properly managed aquaculture facility.</p>

Optimal conversion of feed fed to broilers is very important as it dictates to a very great extent the profitability of broiler production. If the fcr is 2.0 then it takes 2 kg of feed to take a pig from 30 to 31 kg liveweight for example, as opposed to a 3.0 ratio where it takes 3 kg of feed to achieve the same 1 kg of body weight gain and the associated higher feed bill.
