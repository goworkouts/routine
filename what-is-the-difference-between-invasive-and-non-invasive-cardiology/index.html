If your cardiologist identifies a problem with your heart structure, interventional cardiology can make a difference. A healthy heart is very important to a long and healthy lifestyle. Most adult cardiologist today do at lest dianostic caths, but not all. Probably pacemaker stuff like foci ablation and pacemaker implants.
