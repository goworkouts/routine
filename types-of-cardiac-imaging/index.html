<p>Echocardiography (ultrasound) is the most commonly used cardiac imaging modality around the world. Cardiac imaging, also called cardiovascular imaging, is a broad term that includes several ways to take pictures of your heart and surrounding anatomy. Coronary ct angiograms are a special type of ct scan that can look for problems with the heart. Ct coronary angiography and cardiac mri are both relatively recent in their clinical use compared to echocardiography and nuclear cardiac studies, but both provide extremely valuable and additive information to other modalities when used.
