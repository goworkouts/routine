When you’re doing too much cardio, it’s common to feel pain in the knees, hips, feet, and lower back, and you shouldn’t ignore these symptoms, either. Yes it can be, the human body only has so much energy each day and if that person is expending most of their energy doing cardio that is going to leave less energy to focus on building strength and muscle mass which arguably in my opinion and experience takes more energy than doi.
