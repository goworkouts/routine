Cardiovascular fitness is defined as the body’s ability to provide your muscle, organs, and other parts of your body with oxygen while being caught up in a prolonged physical activity or exercise. Physical fitness in its turn has been related to total and cardiovascular mortality [9, 10], and even small improvements in fitness may cause a lower mortality. Running helps build cardiovascular endurance. 3 Best Fitness Tests to Measure Heart Health YouTube.</p>
