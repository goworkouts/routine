Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; Anaerobic activity (like strength training) can increase the strength and density of bones, decreasing the risk of osteoporosis.; Anaerobic workouts are great for building muscle mass and improving power. It can be good to think of aerobic and anaerobic exercises on a scale.

<p>Anaerobic exercise such as resistance training and sprinting can significantly improve measurable quantities of peak strength and power, whereas aerobic exercise is primarily used to improve endurance (time to exhaustion) and total work capacity, as measured by peak oxygen consumption or caloric expenditure. Not only do you burn calories at an advanced rate, you continue to burn calories faster for up to two hours after you’ve completed your workout. The body uses two different energy systems to fuel the body’s activity or exercise. Your body gets to grips with how to utilise more oxygen, which it converts.

One of the most important differences of the aerobic and anaerobic energy system is the speed of the production of energy. Aerobic running happens on those easy runs.

<p>When combined with healthy, balanced nutrition, it has several health benefits such as losing weight, building, maintaining muscle, and enhancing your cardiovascular endurance. Whereas aerobic exercises improve endurance and strengthen the cardiovascular system. One of the most important differences of the aerobic and anaerobic energy system is the speed of the production of energy. The anaerobic system delivers energy significantly faster, and will therefore deliver a greater part of the energy when the intensity is higher. 6 response of the cardiovascular system to exercise.</p>
