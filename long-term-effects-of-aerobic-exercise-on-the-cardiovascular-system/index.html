<p>During exercise blood pressure goes up and then returns to normal. The effects of aerobic exercise can be an effective way to increase the endurance of your cardiorespiratory system. Much the same as resting heart rate, increased stroke volume makes the heart more efficient. This may be explained by the high relative aerobic workload. Exercise atrde.</p>
