<p>If you want to build up some muscle mass, working out your chest once a week maybe the correct routine for you. Instead, it’ s geared toward bodybuilders of at least an intermediate level who can. You can have more time and power to work all part of the pecs, the lower, middle and the upper chest since you have two sessions per week. If you train back and chest together for one session, rather than two separate sessions, you can then train back and chest again for another session.</p>
