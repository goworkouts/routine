How Does Aerobic Exercise Help Prevent Cardiovascular Diseases From lisbonlx.com
Despite strong scientific evidence supporting the benefits of regular exercise for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease (cvd), physical inactivity is highly prevalent worldwide. Hypertension, or elevated blood pressure, leads to increased risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd) and is the number one leading risk factor for mortality [].however, hypertension is also one of the most significant modifiable risk factors in the prevention of cardiovascular disease [].with a prevalence of hypertension in the us population around 29% []. 1 in the united states, the number 1 cause of mortality is coronary heart disease (chd), a condition that comprised 452,300 (20%) of all deaths in 2004. Aerobic exercise included treadmill walking, machine rowing, or cycling.
