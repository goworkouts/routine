Anyone has any insights or is facing the same issue? I&#39;ve had my series 4 watch for more than a year now, but the first cardio fitness data point i can see was recorded just 4 months ago. It can also estimate your vo 2 max if you start an outdoor walk, run, or hike in the workout app. For example, your cardio fitness score may not be accurate if you carry a lot of additional weight when exercising, beyond body weight , like a heavy backpack or water bladder, baby, or child.
