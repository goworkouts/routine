Why Is Aerobic Exercise Better Than Anaerobic Exercise For Weight Loss From dolphingala.weebly.com
Good aerobic fitness can minimize the chances of diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart problems. What is aerobic capacity suggested grade level: This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). Your capacity for something is your ability to do it, or the amount of it that you are.
