What happens at a cpet appointment? When used correctly, these data allow improved clinical decision making in patients with cardiometabolic and respiratory disease. A cardiopulmonary exercise test falls into the category of a stress test because it involves exercise, which stresses the body’s systems, making them work harder, in order to measure. It should be recommended to those who want to understand the basics of cpet and actively participate in clinical rounds where it is discussed as part of patient management.
