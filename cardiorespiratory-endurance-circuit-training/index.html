The sole controlled study to examine the effects of crt in subjects with paraplegia reported significant increases of cardiovascular endurance after 9 wk of training. Perhaps the type of resistance training that brings about the greatest increase in peak oxygen consumption is circuit training using moderate resistances and short rest periods between successive exercises. Therefore resistance training is typically not used as a means of increasing cardiorespiratory endurance.</p>
