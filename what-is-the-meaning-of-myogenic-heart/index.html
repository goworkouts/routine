<p>The heart or cardiac muscle is myogenic meaning that it will independently contract without a stimulus. A myogenic heart contracts by itself without any external stimulus, while a neurogenic heart contracts after receiving an external stimulus in the form of a nerve impulse. Each contraction of the heart muscle regulates the flow of blood in the form of a pulse or heart rate. In mammals heart circulates a huge volume of blood over its lifetime.</p>

<p>A myogenic heart is sort of a human heart. It has a special type of muscle fibres called as cardiac muscles. Take the heart for example, if you take cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) out of the body and keep them alive in a suitable medium, they will continue to contract. Hence, it is known as the pacemaker. Differentiate between Neurogenic heart and Myogenic class 11 biology CBSE.</p>

Vascular tone and tissue perfusion.</p>
<h3 id="heart-transplantation-is-not-possible-in-the-neurogenic-heart">Heart Transplantation Is Not Possible In The Neurogenic Heart.</h3><p>The sa node has the inherent power of generating a wave of contraction and controlling the heart beat. Myogenic heart comprises 2 to 4 chambers. When a heart is transplanted the one coming from the patient on the table ( the patient getting the different heart ) is still beating when removed from the. Contraction is initiated by special node of modified heart muscle, the sinu atrial node located in the atrial and this type of heart has a special type of conducting system this type of heart is called myogenic heart.its examples are vertebrates and molluscals.</p>

A myogenic heart contracts by itself without any external stimulus, while a neurogenic heart contracts after receiving an external stimulus in the form of a nerve impulse. There are specialized cells known as the sinoatrial node or sa node present in the right. This is because heart muscle cells continuously depolarise without any external stimulus.</p>
