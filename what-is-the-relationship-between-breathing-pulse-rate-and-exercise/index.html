<p>When you are running, then you are using your legs to run. Heart rate and blood pressure are controlled separately. The artery wall then contracts to “push” the blood onward, further through the body. Thus your heart pumps blood through your body faster increasing both your heart rate and your breathing rate.

<p>From the graph, we can see that the average heart rate of exercise at 20 minutes 30 seconds is around 171 bpm (pace 3’53’/k), and the average respiration rate is 36brpm. However, they can impact each other. As exercise intensity increases, the heart rate moves closer to its maximum rate.
