<p>In physiology, respiration is the movement of oxygen from the outside environment to the cells within tissues, and the removal of carbon dioxide in the opposite direction that's to the environment. It includes breathing, intake of oxygen, ejecting out co2, using the o2 obtained. This energy usually drives the endothermic reactions taking place in the cell. Respiration is important because it produces energy that is essential for the normal functioning of the body. AP Biology The stages of cellular respiration, Ch. 7.</p>
