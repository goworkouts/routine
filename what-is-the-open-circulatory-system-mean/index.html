In open circulatory system, the rate of circulation is slow whereas it is rapid in closed circulatory. The hemolymph used performs the functions of blood, lymph, &amp; intestinal fluid. Open circulatory systems (evolved in crustaceans, insects, mollusks and other invertebrates) pump blood into a hemocoel with the blood diffusing back to the circulatory system between cells. In a closed circulatory system, blood is enclosed within blood vessels.
