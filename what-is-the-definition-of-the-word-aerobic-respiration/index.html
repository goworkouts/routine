<p>Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. In living cells, a process that uses oxygen to break down complex molecules into simpler ones, releasing energy. Cell respiration usually occurs in the presence of oxygen (see aerobic respiration) but some organisms can respire without oxygen (see anaerobic respiration ). It is a type of respiration that requires oxygen to occur, and produces water, carbon dioxide and atp. Respiration.</p>
