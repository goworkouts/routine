<p>What are the two types of vascular tissues? Dermal tissue is composed of epidermal cells, closely packed cells that secrete a waxy cuticle that aids in the prevention of water loss. They are the conducting tissues that are responsible for the transport of water, mainly the xylem, while the transport of food in plants is done by the phloem tissue. Vascular tissue is comprised of the xylem and the phloem, the main transport systems of plants. Stem Growth Biology for Majors II.</p>
