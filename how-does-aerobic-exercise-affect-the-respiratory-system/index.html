<p>When your activity level changes, your body has to respond by making changes to your respiratory system. This keeps the body diseases free. The human respiratory system is adapted to allow air to pass in and out of the body, and for efficient gas exchange to happen. In addition, the respiratory system helps buffer the metabolic acids as they build up during intense exercise.</p>
