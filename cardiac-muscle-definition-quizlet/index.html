The main types of cardiomyopathy include dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The cardiac cycle is the series of contractions in the heart that pressurize different chambers, causing blood to flood in one direction. The cardiac muscles are tethered to one another by crisscrossing connective tissue of fibers and arranged in circular bundles or spirals. Movement away from the midline.
