Work, energy and power From slideshare.net
In many other sports, including football, good power is also very important as part of the overall fitness profile. As a result, it is important to familiarise yourself with the medical research council’s scale (mrc scale) of muscle power. Work is the product of a force on an object, and remember, muscular strength is the maximal amount of force muscles can exert on an object. As a result, it is important to familiarise yourself with the medical research council’s scale (mrc scale) of muscle power.

<p>Work is the force x the distance. However, muscular power is the capacity to exert that same force several times in a coordinated manner and in the shortest possible time. Power is, by definition, the rate of doing work. So, if we move fast we have increased power because we are doing things in less time.</p>
