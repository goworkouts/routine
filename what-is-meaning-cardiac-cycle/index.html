<p>The cardiac cycle occurs in. As a result, it causes action potentials that spread throughout the atrial and ventricular muscle fibres. The events involved in a single cardiac cycle are atrial systole, atrial diastole, ventricular systole, ventricular diastole, joint diastole. The cardiac cycle comprises all of the physiological events associated with a single heartbeat, including electrical events, mechanical events (pressures and volumes), and heart sounds.
