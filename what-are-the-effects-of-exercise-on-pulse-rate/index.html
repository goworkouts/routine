The effect of exercise on pulse rate essay the effect of exercise on pulse rate what is a pulse in physiology a pulse is where there is a recurring opening out of the biggest blood vessels arteries. Therefore, the heart muscle can pump more volume of blood per beat than a normal person. The pulse rate and breathing rate of a fitter person rise much less than in an unfir person during exercise, fitter people also have a shorter recovery time. When exercising our muscles contract more often and require more energy.

<p>Therefore, their heart needs less beats to pump the oxygenated blood to the muscles in need of it. The heartbeat will increase and become stronger to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the muscle cells. During exercise, the heart must beat faster to eliminate excess carbon dioxide and increase the supply of oxygen in the body.

<p>Kaiser permanente explains that when your heart gets stronger, it pushes out more blood with every beat â which means it doesn't have to work as hard to circulate adequate oxygen and nutrients when you exercise. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit.
