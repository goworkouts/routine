Antiphospholipid syndrome and kidney disease Kidney International From kidney-international.org
Antiphospholipid syndrome (aps) is an autoimmune disease and is a risk factor for a number of clinical manifestations; These autoantibodies can affect the body’s ability to regulate blood clotting in a way that is not well understood. Cardiolipin antibodies are frequently seen with autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), and with other antiphospholipid antibodies, such as.
