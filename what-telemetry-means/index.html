Telemetry, highly automated communications process by which measurements are made and other data collected at remote or inaccessible points and transmitted to receiving equipment for monitoring, display, and recording. Telemetry is the automatic measurement and wireless transmission of data from remote sources. Telemetry is the act of measuring something remotely, by distance, and automatically. Telemetry is a means by which data is collected from remote or inaccessible devices, or to be more accurate, a means by which it is transmitted by those devices to receivers.

<p>Telemetry is the act of measuring something remotely, by distance, and automatically. In its broadest sense, telematics is the joining of two sciencesâtelecommunications, a branch of technology including phone lines and cables, and informatics such as computer systems. The word telemetry is derived from greek words where tele &amp; meter means âremoteâ &amp; âmeasureâ respectively. Telemetry means the same thing in just about any context.</p>
