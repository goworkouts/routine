<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. The immunoglobulin isotype may be igg, igm or iga. The iga ( immunoglobulin a) test detects the presence of the cardiolipin antibodies in the blood. If someone tests positive for cardiolipin antibodies on an initial test, a second test may be performed later to confirm that the antibodies are persistent [].in addition, healthy individuals can test positive for cardiolipin antibodies [].

<p>The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood clotting, autoimmune diseases like lupus, or repeated miscarriages. Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up, leading to problems with bleeding. Cardiolipin antibodies may be transient, meaning they may be detectable at one point, but not later on. This test helps your healthcare provider diagnose clotting disorders and autoimmune diseases.

<p>Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood clotting, autoimmune diseases like lupus, or repeated miscarriages. Some patients may have a positive family history of recurrent clotting or fetal loss. These are autoantibodies directed against components of the cellular membrane.
